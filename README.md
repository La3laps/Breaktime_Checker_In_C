# Remi's branch

Pause Checker made by Yaman and Rémi at Le Campus Numérique to get a reminder if it is time to go on a break or not/to do our daily signature or not.

```
This program was made with the C programming language using the <time.h> library.

It stores signatures for the day and shows if you signed during the day. (For now it resets in the morning before 10 a.m.)
